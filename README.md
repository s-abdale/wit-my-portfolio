# Coding your React Portfolio

Hello WiT team üëãüèΩ This repository has the starter code from the React website that we started coding in Week 3 Day 3's lecture.  

## üß¢ Recap

In our **src** folder, we have done the following:
1. Created a **Home** page
2. Created a **Header** comopnent
3. Implemented routing by adding a **link** inside our Header. (Similar to how we used an < a > tag to switch between pages in the HTML demo)  

We also added 'react-router-dom' in **package.json** to enable the use of routing. üìπ Check out the lecture recording for a detailed walkthrough.  

## üñ• Starting your server:

To get started, first make sure that you're in the correct folder.   
1. Start off by typing `pwd` in your terminal. This will show you where you currently are
2. If you're not in the correct folder, type `ls` to see the contents of the file you're in
3. To move _into_ one of the folders listed, type `cd filename`. To move _out of_ the folder you're in, type `cd ..`
4. Once you're in the folder that contains your react app, type `npm start` and wait for the server to spin up

## üëâüèΩ Next steps  

Your task is to create a multi-page website based on [this](https://www.figma.com/file/ysStCjixdjRBfW7wkSrFw2/WiT-W3D3?node-id=0%3A1) design in Figma.   

The requirements are as follows:
- The dimensions of the **home page** and **header** _must_ match the Figma design requirements (general layout, margins, padding, width, height)
- You can use any image on the home page
- Create a **footer** the same way that we created the header (check the lecture recording üìπ)
- Create an **About me** page. There are no contstraints for this page so have fun with it üé® add anything that you want to this page, just _don't leave it empty!_ üîó Be sure to add a link to this page in the header
- Enjoying coding in React? If you want to continue creating, make another page, perhaps a portfolio page or a list of projects that you want to work on. üîó Be sure to add a link to this page in the header

## üö® Deadline
Spend the weekend coding this site, and send me a screenshot on Slack or via email before **Monday's** lecture. I'm looking forward to seeing your creativity!

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
